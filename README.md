# Pico W Thruster Control

MicroPython control code for using a Raspberry Pi Pico W as a USB serial
controller for thrusters, servo-style outputs, and a single PWM+direction
actuator.

The main firmware is `main.py`. It reads compact ASCII command frames from USB
stdin, looks up each addressed output, and writes the requested value to the
matching motor object.

## Current Pin Map

`main.py` defines six servo-style PWM outputs and one separate actuator output.

| Logical id | GPIO | Driver | Value range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `26` | GP26 | `picozero.Servo` | `0.00` to `1.00` |
| `07` | GP7 | `picozero.Servo` | `0.00` to `1.00` |
| `16` | GP16 | `picozero.Servo` | `0.00` to `1.00` |
| `03` | GP3 | `picozero.Servo` | `0.00` to `1.00` |
| `15` | GP15 | `picozero.Servo` | `0.00` to `1.00` |
| `11` | GP11 | `picozero.Servo` | `0.00` to `1.00` |
| `99` | GP28 PWM, GP21 direction | `DirectionMotor` | `-1.0` to `1.0` |

The servo outputs use this pulse range:

```python
Servo(pin, min_pulse_width=0.0011, max_pulse_width=0.0019)
```

For those outputs, `0.50` is the neutral/midpoint value used by `control.py`.
For the actuator, `0.00` turns PWM off.

## Command Protocol

The firmware expects newline-terminated ASCII frames:

```text
zPPVVVVPPVVVVx
```

Each frame:

- starts with `z`
- contains one or more fixed-width output updates
- ends with `x`

Each output update is exactly six characters:

| Field | Width | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PP` | 2 chars | Logical output id, zero-padded | `07`, `26`, `99` |
| `VVVV` | 4 chars | Value parsed as a float | `0.50`, `1.00`, `-0.5` |

Examples:

```text
z260.50x
z260.50070.50160.50x
z99-0.5x
```

The fixed widths matter. `z260.50x` is valid; `z260.5x` is not, because the
value is only three characters. Positive values should normally be formatted
with two decimal places. Negative values in this protocol are usually one
decimal place so they still fit in four characters, for example `-0.5`.

Pin ids must also be padded to two characters. For example, GPIO 3 is addressed
as `03`, so its neutral command is:

```text
z030.50x
```

If a frame does not start with `z` and end with `x`, `main.py` ignores it. If a
logical id is not present in `MOTOR_LOOKUP`, that specific update is ignored.
The onboard LED toggles after each parsed update, which is useful as a quick
traffic indicator.

## Main Firmware Flow

`main.py` does four things:

1. Creates `MOTOR_LOOKUP`.
2. Adds the actuator as logical id `99`.
3. Adds each configured servo pin as both the logical id and GPIO pin.
4. Starts an async stdin loop that parses command frames forever.

The important constants are:

```python
SERVO_PINS = [26, 7, 16, 3, 15, 11]
EXTRA_SERVO_PINS = []

ACTUATOR_IDX = 99
ACTUATOR_PWM_PIN = 28
ACTUATOR_DIR_PIN = 21
ACTUATOR_PWM_FREQ = 20000
```

`EXTRA_SERVO_PINS` is currently empty. If pins are added there, they use a wider
servo pulse range of `0.0007` to `0.0022` seconds.

## DirectionMotor

`direction_motor.py` wraps a motor driver that has:

- one PWM pin for speed
- one digital direction pin
- an optional `forward_dir` setting

Values are clamped to `-1.0` through `1.0`.

```python
motor.value = 1.0   # full forward
motor.value = -1.0  # full reverse
motor.value = 0.0   # off
```

When the value is positive, the direction pin is set to `forward_dir`. When the
value is negative, the direction pin is inverted. PWM duty is based on the
absolute value.

## Host Control Script

`control.py` opens `/dev/ttyACM0` at `115200` baud and sends command frames to
the Pico.

The `command()` helper formats one complete frame:

```python
def command(pin, value):
    if value < 0:
        value_str = f"{value:.1f}"
    else:
        value_str = f"{value:.2f}"
    return f"z{int(pin):02d}{value_str}x\n"
```

The script currently:

1. Sends `0.50` to every servo output.
2. Builds another all-neutral command payload.
3. Writes that payload repeatedly for timing measurements.
4. Sends final neutral servo values and actuator `99` value `0.00`.

The repeated write is padded to 64 bytes:

```python
ser.write(cmd.encode().ljust(64, b' '))
```

That padding is specific to the current test loop. Keep the fixed-width command
format intact if changing this script.

## Quick Command Reference

Neutralize all six servo outputs in one frame:

```text
z260.50070.50160.50030.50150.50110.50x
```

Turn actuator `99` off:

```text
z990.00x
```

Set actuator `99` to reverse half power:

```text
z99-0.5x
```

Set GP26 to its midpoint:

```text
z260.50x
```

Set GP3 to its midpoint. The pin id is padded as `03`:

```text
z030.50x
```

## Editing Notes

- Keep logical ids two digits wide. The parser slices exactly two characters for
  the id, so pin `3` must be sent as `03`.
- Keep values four characters wide. The parser slices exactly four characters
  for the value.
- Servo ids currently match GPIO pin numbers.
- Actuator id `99` is only a logical id; its real pins are GP28 and GP21.
- Start hardware tests from neutral values before sending larger changes.
